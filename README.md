Openldap - Server
=========

This role aims to setup Openldap and populate the database with the required entries for a minimal working setup.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including
any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables
that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read
from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should
be mentioned here as well.


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables
passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: openldap-server, x: 42 }
